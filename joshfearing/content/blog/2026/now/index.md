## What I am thinking about or doing now:
- Finished what is likely the last CS course I will take: Introduction to Computer Networks.  
- Interested in planning some bike tours and bike commuting (see picture) the coming of spring
- I would like to get involved in some civic tech community here in Madison, similar to Chi Hack Night 
- I have a transit data project in the works: a dashboard of performance metrics for the buses of Madison Metro. I will likely host it here once completed.
